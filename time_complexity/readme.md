## Time Complexity

Time taken by an algorithm as a function of the length of input

To standardise and quantify the algorithm, the Big O Notation comes in picture.

Big O Notation tells us : how much algorithm takes at most time (jada se jada)

example :-

    f(n) = 3n2 + 5n   => O(n2)
    f(n) = n + 100logn  => O(n)
    f(n) = 3n3 + 4n5    => O(n5)
    f(n) = 100000       => O(1)

find upper bound in the expression
uppper bound is n2
then, the complexity is big O of n2 
   or  O(n2)

   1second = 10^8 operations
